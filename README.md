Certainly! The program you provided is a simple currency converter that allows the user to input a source currency, a target currency, and an amount to convert. It uses the `requests` library to fetch exchange rate data from the Frankfurter API and performs the currency conversion. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1. **Import the `requests` Library:**
   ```python
   import requests
   ```
   This line imports the `requests` library, which is used to make HTTP requests to the Frankfurter API.

2. **User Input:**
   ```python
   convertFrom = str(input("Enter the currency you to want from : ")).upper()
   convertTo = str(input("Enter the currency you to want to : ")).upper()
   amount = float(input("Enter the amount you want to convert : "))
   ```
   These lines prompt the user to input the source currency, target currency, and the amount to be converted. The `.upper()` method is used to convert the user inputs to uppercase to ensure consistency.

3. **HTTP Request:**
   ```python
   response = requests.get(f"https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?amount={amount}&from={convertFrom}&to={convertTo}")
   ```
   This line sends an HTTP GET request to the Frankfurter API. It includes the amount, source currency, and target currency as query parameters in the URL. The API is used to get the latest exchange rate data and perform the conversion.

4. **Currency Conversion:**
   ```python
   result = response.json()['rates'][convertTo]
   ```
   This line extracts the converted amount from the JSON response returned by the API. The response contains exchange rates for different currencies, and this code retrieves the conversion rate for the target currency (`convertTo`).

5. **Display the Result:**
   ```python
   print(f'The converted amount of {amount} {convertFrom} to {convertTo} is {result} {convertTo}')
   ```
   This line prints the result of the currency conversion, showing the original amount, source currency, target currency, and the converted amount.

Here's how the program works:
1. The user is prompted to enter the source and target currencies and the amount they want to convert.
2. The program sends an HTTP request to the Frankfurter API with the user's inputs.
3. The API responds with the converted amount.
4. The program displays the result of the conversion to the user.

Note that the program assumes the availability and reliability of the Frankfurter API for exchange rate data. In a production environment, you may want to implement error handling in case the API is unavailable or returns unexpected data.
